        Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. It
        introduced the character of Count Dracula and established many
        conventions of subsequent vampire fantasy. The novel tells the story of
        Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so that he may
        find new blood and spread the undead curse, and of the battle between
        Dracula and Professor Abraham Van Helsing.
